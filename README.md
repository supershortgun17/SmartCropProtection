# Smart Crop Protection: Deep Learning Ensembles for Yield Prediction

## Overview
This project uses an ensemble of deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, DNN) to accurately predict crop yields and detect crop stress under changing climate conditions by analyzing satellite imagery, weather, and soil data. It enables data-driven farming decisions for enhanced productivity and sustainability.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning  
- GPU recommended for faster training (optional but preferred)  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SmartCropProtection
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preparation
- Place your datasets in the `data/` folder:
  - `weather_data.csv` containing weather parameters  
  - `soil_data.csv` containing soil attributes  
  - `yield_data.csv` containing historical crop yield records  
  - Satellite images in the folder `satellite_images/` (named as `<region>_<date>.png`)

- Use the provided preprocessing and feature engineering scripts to clean, normalize, and extract meaningful features.

## Usage

### Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Run preprocessing scripts to prepare data:
```bash
python preprocessing/data_cleaning.py
python preprocessing/feature_engineering.py
```

### Data Splitting
Split data into train and test sets for model evaluation:
```bash
python preprocessing/data_split.py
```

### Training Models
Train base models individually with:
```bash
python training/train_cnn.py
python training/train_lstm.py
python training/train_dnn.py
```

### Ensemble Evaluation
Combine predictions from all models for robust yield prediction:
```bash
python training/train_ensemble.py
```

### Running Main Pipeline
Use `main.py` to execute the full pipeline, from data loading through final ensemble predictions and evaluation.

## Visualization
Use the `utils/visualization.py` module to plot predictions vs actual yields for performance interpretation.

## Contribution
Feedback, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
